                        <h3>What is included in general cleaning?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our general cleaning includes dusting all surfaces, vacuuming carpets and floors, mopping hard floors, kitchen cleaning (counters, sinks, appliances), bathroom cleaning and sanitization, emptying bins, and tidying common areas. We focus on maintaining your home's everyday cleanliness with consistent, reliable service.

                        <h3>How much does regular house cleaning cost?</h3>
                        <p>
                            General cleaning starts from £60 per visit for weekly contracts (less than 3 hours) and £80 for monthly contracts. Prices vary based on duration and frequency. Weekly contracts offer better rates than monthly contracts. <a href="../contact/">Contact us</a> for a personalized quote based on your home's size and needs.

                        <h3>What's the difference between weekly and monthly contracts?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Weekly contracts offer lower per-visit pricing (e.g., £60 vs £80 for under 3 hours) because of the regular commitment and consistency. Monthly contracts have slightly higher per-visit costs but offer flexibility for those who don't need weekly cleaning. Both options provide the same high-quality service.
